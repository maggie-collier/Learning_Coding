# Notes On Learning Languages 
Maggie I love you so much. You're
An unbelievable woman and I'm so proud of who you've become and
Are continuing to become :D seeing your 

Determination to become the best version of yourself is amazing 
And you're such an inspiration to me <3

start typing
stuff
anything random and then
like every five words press
enter
i'm jarod
type o babe
babe use o please its so much faster

## Types of Languages
### Procedural Programming Language: 
A procedural language follows a sequence of statements or commands in order to achieve a desired output. Each series of steps is called a procedure, and a program written in one of these languages will have one or more procedures within it. 
- Java
### Object-oriented Programming Languages (OOP):
This type of language treats a program as a group of objects composed of data and program elements, known as attributes and methods. Objects can be reused within a program or in other programs. This makes it a popular language type for complex programs, as code is easier to reuse and scale.
- Java
- Python
### Scripting Languages:
Programmers use scripting languages to automate repetitive tasks, manage dynamic web content, or support processes in larger applications.
- Python
- bash
### Back-end Languages:
Back-end languages deal with storage and manipulation of the server side of software. This includes data architecture, scripting, and communication between applications and underlying databases.
- Java
- Python
- C#
### High-level vs. Low-level Languages:
**High-level languages** are less memory efficient but  more human friendly. Easier to write, understand, maintain, and debug. Most popular programming languages in use today are considered high-level languages. 

**Low-level languages** are machine-friendly, which makes them highly efficient in terms of memory usage but difficult to understand without the help of an assembler. Machine code is an example.

### Interpreted vs. Compiled Languages:
Differ in how they convert high-level code to be readable by a computer. 

With **interpreted languages**, code goes through a program called an interpreter, which reads and executes the code line by line.
- Python

**Compiled languages** go through a build step where the entire program is converted into machine code. This makes it faster to execute, but it also means that you have to compile or "build" the program again anytime you need to make a change.
- C#

## Software Methodologies
### Waterfall
- old school, traditional methodology
- sequential, plan-driven approach
- lots of up-front planning/discussion between customers and developers to determine project requirements
- operates in stages...requirements, design, implement, test, deploy, maintain
- inflexible, if need to go back and change something, may need to restart entire method
### Agile
- response to problems with waterfall, accommodates change
- customer collaboration throughout, team oriented
- responds to change instead of strict plan
- sprints with defined deliverables
- scrum and extreme programming (XP) are agile frameworks

### Buzzwords:
- **Full-stack developer** has front- and back-end knowledge and can develop for any part of the process
- **Object-oriented programming** utilizes data/objects instead of functions/logic, increasing readability and reusability of code
- **Agile**
- **Waterfall**
- **Scrum**
- **Lean** basic principlesâ€”optimize the whole, eliminate waste, build quality in, create knowledge, defer commitment, deliver fast, and respect people
- **Product backlog** is a prioritized list of work for the development team that is derived from the roadmap and its requirements
- **Stories** informal, short descriptions of a small piece of desired functionality, or smallest unit of work
